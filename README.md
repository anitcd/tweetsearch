# tweetsearch
A tweet search tool (deployed [here](http://anistudy.adaptcentre.ie/tweetsearch/home.jsp)), which was designed to conduct a task-based user study to investigate the search behaviour of users when looking for opinions present in microblogs (tweets). Find more details in my paper [Exploring Search Behaviour in Microblogs](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/FDIA2017.8).
